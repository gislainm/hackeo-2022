# FRONTEND DEVELOPER NOTES
These notes are for developers only. They're used for documenting seemingly-arbitrary changes so that other developers don't undo the changes at a later time. Also used for asynchronously syncing up tech updates with other devs without needing a meeting


 - 'react' decreated to 17.0.2 in order to use 'console-feed'
 - using 'loglevel' temporarily until a better framework with server-sending ability is found
